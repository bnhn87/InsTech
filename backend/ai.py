"""
Stub for AI‑powered item assignment.  In a real implementation you
would call a large language model (LLM) or custom ML model to map
unassigned products to the most appropriate pins on a floor plan.

Given a list of unassigned product lines and the metadata of your
project (floor plan coordinates, existing assignments, etc.), the
function below returns a list of suggested assignments.  Each
assignment maps a product to a pin coordinate or description.

To implement this properly you could use the OpenAI API, a custom
model hosted on your infrastructure, or heuristics.  This stub is
provided to demonstrate the interface and how you might hook it up.

def ai_assign_products(products: List[Dict[str, Any]], floorplan_metadata: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Suggest assignments of unassigned products to locations on a floor plan.

    Args:
        products: List of product dictionaries with at least `code`, `name` and `quantity`.
        floorplan_metadata: Arbitrary metadata about the floor plan (e.g. room labels,
            existing pins, sizes, distances).  The structure is up to you.

    Returns:
        A list of assignment suggestions.  Each suggestion is a dict with keys like
        `product_code`, `suggested_location`, and `confidence` (0.0‑1.0).  For example:

        ```json
        [
          {"product_code": "ABC123", "suggested_location": {"x": 0.45, "y": 0.78}, "confidence": 0.82},
          ...
        ]
        ```

    Note:
        This stub simply returns an empty list.  Replace it with your AI logic.
